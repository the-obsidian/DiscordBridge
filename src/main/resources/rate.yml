# Rate config

# Determines the max rating of the Rate command
# Ratings given by the bot will be expressed on a scale from 0 to this number inclusive
# Must be an integer between 1 and 1000000
rate-out-of: 10

# Determines how many decimal places the rating should be accurate to
# Must be an integer between 0 and 2
rate-granularity: 1

# If true, the bot will make the following replacements in the rating argument to make it feel more conversational:
#   me -> you
#   my -> your
#   myself -> yourself
#   your -> my
#   yourself -> myself
# Example: "rate my build" with a template of "I rate %m..." will become "I rate your build..."

# The responses that are returned by the Rate command
# A message will be displayed if the random number rolled between 0 and rate-out-of falls within the range of
# [low, high] inclusive. For ratings that should appear only for specific values, set low and high to the same value.
# All entries must be prefixed with the "==: Rating" attribute, as shown in the default
# message = the message to display
#   '%m' = the thing that is being rated
#   '%r' = the rating itself, expressed in the form <rating>/<max>
# low = the lower bound at which this message will display, inclusive
# high = the higher bound at which this message will display, inclusive
